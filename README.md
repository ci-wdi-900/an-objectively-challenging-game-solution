# The Objectively Challenging Labyrinth - Solution

### Logic
* Make five monster objects.
* Every time we beat a monster, we lower its hit points.
  * Based on its hit points, we animate the character and give it a life bar.
* Every time its hit points are below 0, we focus on the next monster.
* When we're done with all the monsters, we... celebrate.
